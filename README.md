Assignment #7: 
"Basic Webpage"
Due: July 15, 2024
Overview:

In this assignment, you will combine and build on previously attained HTML, CSS, and JS skills to create a simple webpage with a navigation bar (menu). The page may also serve to support additional functionality developed in future assignments. The page should be hosted on QC Computer Science Department's server.

You may work with a coding partner, but you need to have your own copy of the code hosted on your server account. Your About pages (Developer Info and Contact Me) must be customized to you.
